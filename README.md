# VelectroBot
Coming soon:
We do not know but you can suggest in our soon server
This is the bot that will run the Velectro Technologies Server!
We have decided to make the code public BUT:
You CAN'T post this bot under a new name/token, without major changes.*
You can majorily modify the code, but you must give credits.



*If you want to have the same bot on a different server, feel free to but, you must a) give credits and b)Not use the same name/picture**
**Some lines of code will be mainly for velectro services so you might need to change that
